Today’s world increasingly consists of lifelong learners - people who accept learning doesn’t stop after you’ve finished school. They have to accept it to keep up with ever-changing information, trends and industry standards. While our learning mindset is evolving, our way of recognizing that learning is falling behind.

The first problem is that there’s a gap between formal recognition (such as certifications or degrees), awarded by formal institutions, and informal recognition. Informal recognition for learning you do every day - through helping your peers, attending informal events, writing an article, and so on.

Second - we need to address that recognition is far too often a goal. It shouldn’t be. Recognition is a result of you having applied your learnings and competencies. Your goal should be achieving competence. How many people still go to school for a degree, as opposed to an education?

Lastly, solutions that aim to recognize you, often miss context. A LinkedIn endorsement doesn’t have a context behind it, a reason, a time, a setting. It’s not as if this context in which you’ve improved your skills doesn’t exist. It’s just scattered. Spread out over all of the platforms you use daily. A tweet with a picture of the graduation ceremony at which you received your diploma. A Facebook picture of a hackathon you attended. An open badge you’ve been awarded for completing a course online. That’s useful and meaningful context. You become a little more competent every day, through engaging with your interests, hobbies and education.

In short - we need a companion for lifelong learners. A companion that puts skills first, and low-barrier recognition for them second.
